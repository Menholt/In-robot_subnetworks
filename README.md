In this thesis the interference power from in-robot subnetworks is modelled, analyzed and predicted. The interference power can be simulated using various model assumptions. The interference power is analyzed with regards to mean, temporal correlation and distribution. Lastly, the interference power is predicted with an autoregressive model, and the accuracy is measured with respect to normalized mean square error.
